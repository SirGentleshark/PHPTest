# PHP test
# IDENTIFIED BAD PRACTICES

- Done
    - Lack of code comments
    - Lack of Namespace declaration
    - Protected rather than private properties
    - No type hint when declaring properties
    - Lack of return type hint for Getters
    - Use of string for DateTime rather than immutible format like DateTimeImmutable
    - Setter methods did not allow for method chaining by having no return value

  - To be done
    - No use of composer for autoload to make proper use of Namespace
    - No Try/Catch error handingT
    - Remove use of Singleton pattern
    - SQL Queries aren't parameterized to prevent SQL injections
